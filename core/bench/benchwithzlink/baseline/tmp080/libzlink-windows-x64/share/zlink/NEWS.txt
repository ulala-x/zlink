  libzlink is now distributed under the Mozilla Public License 2.0. Relicensing
  grants have been collected from all relevant authors, and some functionality
  has been clean-room reimplemented where that was not possible. In layman terms,
  the new license provides the same rights and obligations as before. Source
  files are now tagged using the SPDX license identifier format.
  Details of the relicensing process can be seen at:

0MQ version 4.3.3 stable, released on 2020/09/07
================================================

* Security advisories:
  * CVE-2020-15166: Denial-of-Service on CURVE/ZAP-protected servers by
    unauthenticated clients.
    If a raw TCP socket is opened and connected to an endpoint that is fully
    configured with CURVE/ZAP, legitimate clients will not be able to exchange
    any message. Handshakes complete successfully, and messages are delivered to
    the library, but the server application never receives them.
    For more information see the security advisory:
    https://github.com/zlink/libzlink/security/advisories/GHSA-25wp-cf8g-938m
  * Stack overflow on server running PUB/XPUB socket (CURVE disabled).
    The PUB/XPUB subscription store (mtrie) is traversed using recursive
    function calls. In the remove (unsubscription) case, the recursive calls are
    NOT tail calls, so even with optimizations the stack grows linearly with the
    length of a subscription topic. Topics are under the control of remote
    clients - they can send a subscription to arbitrary length topics. An
    attacker can thus cause a server to create an mtrie sufficiently large such
    that, when unsubscribing, traversal will cause a stack overflow.
    For more information see the security advisory:
    https://github.com/zlink/libzlink/security/advisories/GHSA-qq65-x72m-9wr8
  * Memory leak in PUB server induced by malicious client(s) without CURVE/ZAP.
    Messages with metadata are never processed by PUB sockets, but the metadata
    is kept referenced in the PUB object and never freed.
    For more information see the security advisory:
    https://github.com/zlink/libzlink/security/advisories/GHSA-4p5v-h92w-6wxw
  * Memory leak in client induced by malicious server(s) without CURVE/ZAP.
    When a pipe processes a delimiter and is already not in active state but
    still has an unfinished message, the message is leaked.
    For more information see the security advisory:
    https://github.com/zlink/libzlink/security/advisories/GHSA-wfr2-29gj-5w87
  * Heap overflow when receiving malformed ZMTP v1 packets (CURVE disabled).
    By crafting a packet which is not valid ZMTP v2/v3, and which has two
    messages larger than 8192 bytes, the decoder can be tricked into changing
    the recorded size of the 8192 bytes static buffer, which then gets overflown
    by the next message. The content that gets written in the overflown memory
    is entirely decided by the sender.
    For more information see the security advisory:
    https://github.com/zlink/libzlink/security/advisories/GHSA-fc3w-qxf5-7hp6

* Note for packagers: an external, self-contained sha1 library is now
  included in the source tree under core/external/sha1/ - it is licensed
  under BSD-3-Clause and thus it is fully compatible with libzlink's
  license.
  It is only used if WebSockets support is enabled, and if neither GnuTLS nor
  NSS are available.

* Note for packagers: an internal reimplementation of strlcpy is now included,
  for wider platform compatibility.
  libbsd can be used and is enabled by default if available instead of the
  internal implementation, for better security maintenance in distros.

* Note for packagers: ZlinkConfig.cmake is now installed in the arch-dependent
  subdirectory - eg: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/

* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) socket type:
  - ZLINK_CHANNEL is a thread-safe alternative to ZLINK_PAIR.
  See doc/zlink_socket.txt for details.

* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) socket option:
  - ZLINK_ONLY_FIRST_SUBSCRIBE will cause only the first part of a multipart
    message to be processed as a subscribe/unsubscribe message, and the rest
    will be forwarded as user data to the application.
  - ZLINK_RECONNECT_STOP will cause a connecting socket to stop trying to
    reconnect in specific circumstances. See the manpage for details.
  - ZLINK_HELLO_MSG to set a message that will be automatically sent to a new
    connection.
  - ZLINK_DISCONNECT_MSG to set a message that will be automatically received when
    a peer disconnects.
  See doc/zlink_setsockopt.txt and doc/zlink_getsockopt.txt for details.

* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) zlink_ctx_get_ext/zlink_ctx_set_ext APIs were added
  to allow enhancing the context options with variable data inputs.
  See doc/zlink_ctx_get_ext.txt and doc/zlink_ctx_set_ext.txt for details.

* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) transport options WS and WSS added for support
  of WebSockets (and secure WebSockets via TLS) via the ZWS 2.0 protocol.
  WSS requires the GnuTLS library for TLS support. ZLINK_WSS_ specific socket
  options were added to support TLS.
  WebSockets support is disabled by default if DRAFT APIs are disabled.

* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) socket type, PEER, which is thread safe and a
  related zlink_connect_peer function which atomically and thread-safely connects
  and returns a routing-id.

* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) zlink_msg_init_buffer API was added to allow
  the construction of a message by copying from an existing buffer.

* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) zlink_poller_size API was added to allow querying
  the number of sockets/fds registered in a zlink_poller.

* ZMTP 3.1 peers will receive subscribe/cancel on PUB/SUB via commands rather
  than using the first byte of the payload.

* zlink_z85_decode now checks that the input string's length is at least 5 characters
  and always a multiple of 5 as per API specification.

0MQ version 4.3.2 stable, released on 2019/07/08
================================================

* CVE-2019-13132: a remote, unauthenticated client connecting to a
  libzlink application, running with a socket listening with CURVE
  encryption/authentication enabled, may cause a stack overflow and
  overwrite the stack with arbitrary data, due to a buffer overflow in
  the library. Users running public servers with the above configuration
  are highly encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible, as there are no
  known mitigations. All versions from 4.0.0 and upwards are affected.
  Thank you Fang-Pen Lin for finding the issue and reporting it!

* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) zlink_socket_monitor_versioned API that supports
  a versioned monitoring events protocol as a parameter. Passing 1 results in
  the same behaviour as zlink_socket_monitor.
  Version 2 of the events protocol allows new events, new metadata, different
  socket types for the monitors and more. It is described in details in
  doc/zlink_socket_monitor_versioned.txt

* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) zlink_socket_monitor_pipes_stats that triggers
  a new ZLINK_EVENT_PIPES_STATS to be delivered via zlink_socket_monitor_versioned
  v2 API, which contains the current status of all the queues owned by the
  monitored socket. See doc/zlink_socket_monitor_versioned.txt for details.

* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) zlink_poller_fd that returns the FD of a thread
  safe socket. See doc/zlink_poller.txt for details.

* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) socket options:
  - ZLINK_XPUB_MANUAL_LAST_VALUE is similar to ZLINK_XPUB_MANUAL but allows to avoid
    duplicates when using last value caching.
  See doc/zlink_setsockopt.txt and doc/zlink_getsockopt.txt for details.

* Implemented background thread names for Windows, when the Visual Studio
  debugger is being used.

* Fixed #3358 - test_security_zap failing due to SIGBUS on SPARC64, hard-coded
                IPC socket binds in tests cause race conditions

* Fixed #3361 - enabling GSSAPI support (when using autools) does not work due
                to regression introduced in 4.2.3

* Fixed #3362 - remove documentation for ZLINK_THREAD_PRIORITY context option
                getter, it's not implemented

* Fixed #3363 - tests fail to build due to stricter compiler printf validation
                in new versions of GCC

* Fixed #3367 - try to infer cacheline size at build time, first with
                getconf LEVEL1_DCACHE_LINESIZE, and then by reading
                /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cache/index0/coherency_line_size
                (autoconf only), and only then falling back to the previous
                default of 64 bytes. Avoids false sharing on POWER and s390x.
                Import ax_func_posix_memalign.m4 as a more reliable check for
                posix_memalign presence on some unix platforms.
                Prefer c++11 atomic primitives to compiler intrinsics, when
                both are available, as the former is more reliable.
                Set test_pair_ipc and test_rebind_ipc to XFAIL on GNU/Hurd due
                to non-functioning getsockname on AF_UNIX.

* Fixed #3370 - Make queue length and HWM state observable

* Fixed #3373 - performance regression in zlink_poll on CentOS 6/7

* Fixed #3375 - assign names to all pthreads created by the library to ease
                debugging

* Fixed #3376 - assigned random TIPC port is not returned by ZLINK_LAST_ENDPOINT

* Fixed #3385 - TCP port in ZLINK_LAST_ENDPOINT depends on global locale

* Fixed #3404 - use std::condition_variable_any when possible

* Fixed #3436 - reconnect interval exponential backoff and may lead to integer
                overflows

* Fixed #3440 - improve zlink_proxy performance by batching of up to 1000
                consecutive messages (if any) and add perf/proxy_thr tool

* Fixed #3537 - fix build on z/OS by using pthread_equal instead of comparing
                variables directly

* Fixed #3546 - CMake links with librt on MinGW which is not available

* Many coding style, duplication, testing and static analysis improvements.


0MQ version 4.3.1 stable, released on 2019/01/12
================================================

* CVE-2019-6250: A vulnerability has been found that would allow attackers to
  direct a peer to jump to and execute from an address indicated by the
  attacker.
  This issue has been present since v4.2.0. Older releases are not affected.
  NOTE: The attacker needs to know in advance valid addresses in the peer's
  memory to jump to, so measures like ASLR are effective mitigations.
  NOTE: this attack can only take place after authentication, so peers behind
  CURVE/GSSAPI are not vulnerable to unauthenticated attackers.
  See https://github.com/zlink/libzlink/issues/3351 for more details.
  Thanks to Guido Vranken for uncovering the issue and providing the fix!

* Note for packagers: as pkg-config's Requires.private is now used to properly
  propagate dependencies for static builds, the libzlink*-dev or zlink-devel or
  equivalent package should now depend on the libfoo-dev or foo-devel packages
  of all the libraries that zlink is linked against, or pkg-config --libs libzlink
  will fail due to missing dependencies on end users machines.

* Fixed #3351 - remote code execution vulnerability.

* Fixed #3343 - race condition in ZLINK_PUSH when quickly disconnecting and
                reconnecting causes last part of multi-part message to get
                "stuck" and resent by mistake to the new socket.

* Fixed #3336 - set Requires.private in generate pkg-config file.

* Fixed #3334 - set TCP_NODELAY after connect() on Windows for the I/O socket.

* Fixed #3326 - assert on Android when opening a socket and disabling WiFi.

* Fixed #3320 - build failure on OpenBSD with GCC.

0MQ version 4.3.0 stable, released on 2018/11/28
================================================

* The following DRAFT APIs have been marked as STABLE and will not change
  anymore:
  - ZLINK_MSG_T_SIZE context option (see doc/zlink_ctx_get.txt)
  - ZLINK_THREAD_AFFINITY_CPU_ADD and ZLINK_THREAD_AFFINITY_CPU_REMOVE (Posix only)
    context options, to add/remove CPUs to the affinity set of the I/O threads.
    See doc/zlink_ctx_set.txt and doc/zlink_ctx_get.txt for details.
  - ZLINK_THREAD_NAME_PREFIX (Posix only) context option, to add a specific
    integer prefix to the background threads names, to easily identify them.
    See doc/zlink_ctx_set.txt and doc/zlink_ctx_get.txt for details.
  - ZLINK_GSSAPI_PRINCIPAL_NAMETYPE and ZLINK_GSSAPI_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAMETYPE
    socket options, for the corresponding GSSAPI features. Additional
    definitions for principal name types:
    - ZLINK_GSSAPI_NT_HOSTBASED
    - ZLINK_GSSAPI_NT_USER_NAME
    - ZLINK_GSSAPI_NT_KRB5_PRINCIPAL
    See doc/zlink_gssapi.txt for details.
  - ZLINK_BINDTODEVICE socket option (Linux only), which will bind the
    socket(s) to the specified interface. Allows to use Linux VRF, see:
    https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/vrf.txt
    NOTE: requires the program to be ran as root OR with CAP_NET_RAW
  - zlink_timers_* APIs. These functions can be used for cross-platforms timed
    callbacks. See doc/zlink_timers.txt for details.
  - The following socket monitor events:
    - ZLINK_EVENT_HANDSHAKE_FAILED_NO_DETAIL: unknown errors during handshake.
    - ZLINK_EVENT_HANDSHAKE_SUCCEEDED: Handshake completed with authentication.
    - ZLINK_EVENT_HANDSHAKE_FAILED_PROTOCOL: Protocol errors with peers or ZAP.
    - ZLINK_EVENT_HANDSHAKE_FAILED_AUTH: Failed authentication requests.
    See doc/zlink_socket_monitor.txt for more details and error codes.
  - zlink_stopwatch_intermediate which returns the time elapsed without stopping
    the stopwatch.
  - zlink_proxy_steerable command 'STATISTICS' to retrieve stats about the amount
    of messages and bytes sent and received by the proxy.
    See doc/zlink_proxy_steerable.txt for more information.

* The build-time configuration option to select the poller has been split, and
  new API_POLLER (CMake) and --with-api-poller (autoconf) options will now
  determine what system call is used to implement the zlink_poll/zlink_poller APIs.
  The previous POLLER and --with-poller options now only affects the
  internal I/O thread. In case API_POLLER is not specified, the behaviour keeps
  backward compatibility intact and will be the same as with previous releases.

* The non-default "poll" poller for the internal I/O thread (note: NOT for the
  zlink_poll/zlink_poller user APIs!) has been disabled on Windows as WSAPoll does
  not report connection failures. For more information see:
  - https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2012/10/10/wsapoll-is-broken/
  - https://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2012-10/0038.html
  - https://bugs.python.org/issue16507

* New epoll implementation for Windows, using the following implementation:
  https://github.com/piscisaureus/wepoll/tree/v1.5.4
  To use this, select "epoll" as the poller option in the build system.
  Note for distributors: the wepoll source code is embedded and distributed.
  It is licensed under the BSD-2-Clause and thus it is compatible with LGPL-3.0.
  Note that, if selected at build time, the license text must be distributed
  with the binary in accordance to the license terms. A copy can be found at:
  core/external/wepoll/license.txt

* The pre-made Visual Studio solutions file are deprecated, and users are
  encouraged to use the CMake solution generation feature instead.

* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) socket options:
  - ZLINK_ROUTER_NOTIFY to deliver a notification when a peer connects and/or
    disconnects in the form of a routing id plus a zero-length frame.
  - ZLINK_MULTICAST_LOOP to control whether the data sent should be looped back
    on local listening sockets for UDP multicast sockets (ZLINK_RADIO).
  See doc/zlink_setsockopt.txt and doc/zlink_getsockopt.txt for details.

* New perf tool, perf/benchmark_radix_tree, to measure the performance of the
  different internal implementations of the trie algorithm used to track
  subscriptions. Requires a compiler that supports C++11.

* New autoconf flag "--enable-force-CXX98-compat" which will force -std=gnu++98
  and, if the compiler supports them (clang++ at the moment), it will also add
  -Wc++98-compat -Wc++98-compat-pedantic so that compatibility with C++98 can
  be tested.

                multicast address for multi-homed hosts.

* Fixed #2891 - UDP: address name resolution is limited to dotted IPv4 rather
                than being capable of IPv4, IPv6, and hostname lookup.

                of a class declared as a global static


0MQ version 4.2.3 stable, released on 2017/12/13
================================================

* API change: previously ZLINK_POLLOUT on a ZLINK_ROUTER socket returned always
  true due to how the type works. When ZLINK_ROUTER_MANDATORY is set, sending
  fails when the peer is not available, but ZLINK_POLLOUT always returns true
  anyway, which does not make sense. Now when ZLINK_ROUTER_MANDATORY is set,
  ZLINK_POLLOUT on a ZLINK_ROUTER will return true only if at least one peer is
  available.
  Given ZLINK_POLLOUT with ZLINK_ROUTER was not usable at all previously, we do
  not consider this a breakage warranting a major or minor version increase.

* ZLINK_IDENTITY has been renamed to ZLINK_ROUTING_ID and ZLINK_CONNECT_RID has been
  renamed to ZLINK_CONNTECT_ROUTING_ID to disambiguate. ZLINK_IDENTITY and
  ZLINK_CONNECT_RID are still available to keep backward compatibility, and will
  be removed in a future release after further advance notice.

* DRAFT API change: zlink_poller_wait, zlink_poller_wait_all and zlink_poller_poll
  have been changed to be inline with other existing APIs that have a timeout
  to return EAGAIN instead of ETIMEDOUT as the errno value.
  See #2713 for details.

* Existing non-DRAFT socket types ZLINK_REP/REQ, ZLINK_ROUTER/DEALER and
  ZLINKPUB/SUB, that were previously declared deprecated, have been reinstated
  as stable and supported. See #2699 for details.

* Tweetnacl: add support for, and use preferably if available, getrandom() as
  a simpler and less error-prone alternative to /dev/urandom on OSes where it
  is available (eg: Linux 3.18 with glibc 2.25).

* Curve: all remaining traces of debug output to console are now removed, and
  new DRAFT events are available to properly debug CURVE, PLAIN, GSSAPI and
  ZAP events and failures. See below for details on the new events.

* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) socket options:
  - ZLINK_GSSAPI_PRINCIPAL_NAMETYPE and ZLINK_GSSAPI_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAMETYPE, for
    the corresponding GSSAPI features. Additional definitions for principal
    name types:
    - ZLINK_GSSAPI_NT_HOSTBASED
    - ZLINK_GSSAPI_NT_USER_NAME
    - ZLINK_GSSAPI_NT_KRB5_PRINCIPAL
    See doc/zlink_gssapi.txt for details.
  - ZLINK_BINDTODEVICE (Linux only), which will bind the socket(s) to the
    specified interface. Allows to use Linux VRF, see:
    https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/vrf.txt
    NOTE: requires the program to be ran as root OR with CAP_NET_RAW
  - ZLINK_ZAP_ENFORCE_DOMAIN, enables strict RFC 27 compatibility mode and makes
    the ZAP Domain mandatory when using security. See:
    https://rfc.zlink.org/spec:27/ZAP
  See doc/zlink_setsockopt.txt and doc/zlink_getsockopt.txt for details.

* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) context options:
  - ZLINK_THREAD_AFFINITY_CPU_ADD and ZLINK_THREAD_AFFINITY_CPU_REMOVE (Posix only),
    to add and remove CPUs to the affinity set of the I/O threads. Useful to pin
    the background threads to specific CPUs.
  - ZLINK_THREAD_NAME_PREFIX (Posix only), to add a specific integer prefix to the
    background threads names, to easily identify them for debugging purposes.
  See doc/zlink_ctx_set.txt and doc/zlink_ctx_get.txt for details.

* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) message property name definitions to facilitate
  the use of zlink_msg_gets:
  - ZLINK_MSG_PROPERTY_ROUTING_ID
  - ZLINK_MSG_PROPERTY_SOCKET_TYPE
  - ZLINK_MSG_PROPERTY_USER_ID
  - ZLINK_MSG_PROPERTY_PEER_ADDRESS
  See doc/zlink_msg_gets.txt for details.

* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) API zlink_socket_get_peer_state, to be used to
  query the state of a specific peer (via routing-id) of a ZLINK_ROUTER socket.

* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) Socket Monitor events:
  - ZLINK_EVENT_HANDSHAKE_FAILED_NO_DETAIL, unknown system error and returns errno
  - ZLINK_EVENT_HANDSHAKE_SUCCEEDED, handshake was successful
  - ZLINK_EVENT_HANDSHAKE_FAILED_PROTOCOL, protocol errors between peers or server
    and ZAP handler. Returns one of ZLINK_PROTOCOL_ERROR_* - see manpage for list
  - ZLINK_EVENT_HANDSHAKE_FAILED_AUTH, failed authentication, returns ZAP status
  These events trigger when the ZMTP security mechanism handshake is
  completed or failed. See doc/zlink_socket_monitor.txt for more information.

* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) zlink_proxy_steerable command 'STATISTICS' to
  retrieve stats about the amount of messages and bytes sent and received by
  the proxy. See doc/zlink_proxy_steerable.txt for more information.

* Add new autoconf --disable-libunwind option to stop building with libunwind
  even if it is available.

* Add new autoconf --disable-Werror option to avoid building with the Werror
  flag.

* Use pkg-config as the first method for finding and building with external
  optional dependencies such as libnorm, libpgm and gssapi.

* On Posix platform where the feature is available, name the ZLINK background
  threads to simplify debugging: "ZLINKbg/<num_thread>"

* Improve performance of zlink_poller_* (and zlink_poll and zlink_proxy when building
  with DRAFT APIs enabled).

* The TCP unit tests have been refactored to bind and connect to random ports
  rather than hard-coded ones, to allow running tests in parallel.
  There are 6 exceptions where it is necessary to use an hard-coded port to
  test specific code paths that would not be exercised when binding to a
  wildcard port. These are listed in tests/testutil.hpp so that distributions
  can easily patch them if they wish to and so that they can be unique across
  all the tests, allowing parallel runs.
  The IPC unit tests have been changed as well to use unique socket file names
  per test, where before there were some clashes.

* Fixed #2349 - fix building with libsodium when using CMake

=============================================

* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) Socket Monitor events:
  - ZLINK_EVENT_HANDSHAKE_SUCCEED

0MQ version 4.2.0 stable, released on 2016/11/04
=============================================

* For Pieter. Thanks for making all of this possible.

  "Tell them I was a writer.
   A maker of software.
   A humanist. A father.
   And many things.
   But above all, a writer.
   Thank You. :)"
   - Pieter Hintjens

* This release introduces new APIs, but it is ABI compatible with
  libzlink 4.1.2 and up.

* Note for ARM and SPARC users: an alignment problem in zlink_msg_t that could in
  some cases and on some CPUs cause a SIGBUS error was solved, but it requires
  a rebuild of your application against the 4.2.0 version of include/zlink.h.
  To clarify, this change does not affect the internals of the library but only
  the public definition of zlink_msg_t, so there is no ABI incompatibility.

* Security with Curve is now available by default thanks to Tweetnacl sources:
  https://tweetnacl.cr.yp.to/index.html
  Libsodium is still fully supported but has to be enabled with the build flag
  --with-libsodium. Distribution and package maintainers are encouraged to use
  libsodium so that the security implementation can be audited and maintained
  separately.

* New Context options:
  - ZLINK_MAX_MSGSZ
  - ZLINK_BLOCKY
  See doc/zlink_ctx_set.txt and doc/zlink_ctx_get.txt for details.

* New Socket options:
  - ZLINK_HANDSHAKE_IVL
  - ZLINK_XPUB_NODROP
  - ZLINK_XPUB_MANUAL
  - ZLINK_XPUB_WELCOME_MSG
  - ZLINK_STREAM_NOTIFY
  - ZLINK_INVERT_MATCHING
  - ZLINK_HEARTBEAT_IVL
  - ZLINK_HEARTBEAT_TTL
  - ZLINK_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT
  - ZLINK_XPUB_VERBOSER
  - ZLINK_CONNECT_TIMEOUT
  - ZLINK_TCP_MAXRT
  - ZLINK_THREAD_SAFE
  - ZLINK_MULTICAST_MAXTPDU
  - ZLINK_VMCI_BUFFER_SIZE
  - ZLINK_VMCI_BUFFER_MIN_SIZE
  - ZLINK_VMCI_BUFFER_MAX_SIZE
  - ZLINK_VMCI_CONNECT_TIMEOUT
  - ZLINK_USE_FD
  See doc/zlink_setsockopt.txt and doc/zlink_getsockopt.txt for details.

* New CURVE helper function to derive z85 public key from secret key:
    zlink_curve_public

* New cross-platform atomic counter helper functions:
    zlink_atomic_counter_new, zlink_atomic_counter_set, zlink_atomic_counter_inc,
    zlink_atomic_counter_dec, zlink_atomic_counter_value, zlink_atomic_counter_destroy
  See doc/zlink_atomic_*.txt for details.

* New DRAFT APIs early-release mechanism. New APIs will be introduced early
  in public releases, and until they are stabilized and guaranteed not to
  change anymore they will be unavailable unless the new build flag
  --enable-drafts is used. This will allow developers and early adopters to
  test new APIs before they are finalized.
  NOTE: as the name implies, NO GUARANTEE is made on the stability of these APIs.
  They might change or disappear entirely. Distributions are recommended NOT to
  build with them.

  New socket types have been introduced in DRAFT state:
    ZLINK_SERVER, ZLINK_CLIENT, ZLINK_RADIO, ZLINK_DISH, ZLINK_GATHER, ZLINK_SCATTER,
    ZLINK_DGRAM
  All these sockets are THREAD SAFE, unlike the existing socket types. They do
  NOT support multipart messages (ZLINK_SNDMORE/ZLINK_RCVMORE).
  ZLINK_RADIO, ZLINK_DISH and ZLINK_DGRAM also support UDP as transport,
  both unicast and multicast. See doc/zlink_udp.txt for more details.
  New methods to support the new socket types functionality:
    zlink_join, zlink_leave, zlink_msg_set_routing_id, zlink_msg_routing_id,
    zlink_msg_set_group, zlink_msg_group
  See doc/zlink_socket.txt for more details.

  New poller mechanism and APIs have been introduced in DRAFT state:
    zlink_poller_new, zlink_poller_destroy, zlink_poller_add, zlink_poller_modify,
    zlink_poller_remove, zlink_poller_wait, zlink_poller_wait_all, zlink_poller_add_fd
    zlink_poller_modify_fd, zlink_poller_remove_fd
  and a new supporting struct typedef: zlink_poller_event_t
  They support existing socket type, new thread-safe socket types and file
  descriptors (cross-platform).
  Documentation will be made available in the future before these APIs are declared
  stable.

  New cross-platform timers helper functions have been introduced in DRAFT state:
    zlink_timers_new, zlink_timers_destroy, zlink_timers_add, zlink_timers_cancel,
    zlink_timers_set_interval, zlink_timers_reset, zlink_timers_timeout,
    zlink_timers_execute
  and a new supporting callback typedef: zlink_timer_fn

* Many, many bug fixes. The most important fixes are backported and captured in the
  4.1.x and 4.0.x changelogs.

0MQ version 4.0.1 stable, released on 2013/10/08
================================================

Changes
-------

* Updated CURVE mechanism to track revised RFC 27 (INITIATE vouch).

  The INITIATE command vouch box is Box[C',S](C->S') instead of
  Box[C'](C->S), to reduce the risk of client impersonation, as per
  https://codesinchaos.wordpress.com/2012/09/09/curvecp-1/.

* Fixed LIBZLINK-567, adding abstract namespaces for IPC sockets on Linux.

  Converts an initial strudel or "at sign" (@) in the Unix socket path to
  a NULL character ('\0') indicating that the socket uses the abstract
  namespace instead of the filesystem namespace.  For instance, binding a
  socket to 'ipc://@/tmp/tester' will not create a file associated with
  the socket whereas binding to 'ipc:///tmp/tester' will create the file
  /tmp/tester. See issue 567 for more information.

* Added zlink_z85_encode and zlink_z85_decode to core libzlink API.

* Added zlink_curve_keypair to core libzlink API.

* Bumped library ABI version to 4:0:1.

Bug fixes
---------

* Fixed some build/test errors on OS/X + Clang++.

* Fixed LIBZLINK-565, typo in code.

* Fixed LIBZLINK-566, dealer-to-router connections sometimes failing.

* Fixed builds for AIX, MSVC 2008, OS/X with clang++, Solaris.

* Improved CURVE handshake error handling.


0MQ version 4.0.0 (RC1), released on 2013/09/20
===============================================

Major changes
-------------

* New wire level protocol, ZMTP/3.0, see http://rfc.zlink.org/spec:23.
  Does not yet implement the SUBSCRIBE, CANCEL, PING, and PONG commands.
  
* New security framework, from plain user+password to strong encryption, 
  see section below. See http://hintjens.com/blog:49 for a tutorial.
  
* New ZLINK_STREAM socket type for working as a TCP client or server. See: 
  tests/test_stream.cpp.
  
Improvements
------------

* You can now connect to an inproc:// endpoint that does not already
  exist. This means inproc:// no longer needs careful set-up, but it may
  break code that relied on the old behaviour. See: 
  tests/test_inproc_connect.cpp.
 
* Libzlink now checks socket types at connection time, so that trying to 
  connect a 'wrong' socket type will fail.
  
* New zlink_ctx_shutdown API method will shutdown a context and send ETERM
  to blocking calls, without blocking. Use zlink_ctx_term to finalise the
  process.
  
* The regression test suite has been significantly extended and improved.
  
* Contexts can now be terminated in forked child processes. See: 
  tests/test_fork.cpp.
  
* zlink_disconnect now respects the linger setting on sockets.

* New zlink_send_const API method to send constant data (without copying).
  See: tests/test_inproc_connect.cpp.
  
* Added CMake support for static libraries.

* Added test cases for socket semantics as defined in RFCs 28, 29, 30, 31.
  See: tests/test_spec_*.cpp.

* New socket option, ZLINK_PROBE_ROUTER triggers an empty message on connect.
  See: tests/test_probe_router.cpp.
  
* New socket option, ZLINK_REQ_CORRELATE allows for correlation of replies 
  from a REP socket. See: tests/test_req_correlate.cpp.
  
* New socket option, ZLINK_REQ_RELAXED, lets you disable the state machine 
  on a REQ socket, so you can send multiple requests without waiting for 
  replies, and without getting an EFSM error. See: 
  tests/test_req_relaxed.cpp.
  
* New socket option, ZLINK_CONFLATE restricts the outgoing and incoming 
  socket buffers to a single message. See: tests/test_conflate.cpp.

Deprecated Options
------------------

* ZLINK_IPV4ONLY deprecated and renamed to ZLINK_IPV6 so that options are
  consistently "off" by default. 

* ZLINK_DELAY_ATTACH_ON_CONNECT deprecated, and renamed to ZLINK_IMMEDIATE.
  See: tests/test_immediate.cpp.

Security Framework
------------------

Based on new ZMTP wire level protocol that negotiates a security 
"mechanism" between client and server before exchanging any other data.

Security mechanisms are extensible. ZMTP defines three by default:

* NULL - classic Zlink, with no authentication. See 
  http://rfc.zlink.org/spec:23.
  
* PLAIN - plain-text username + password authentication. See
  http://rfc.zlink.org/spec:24.

* CURVE - secure authentication and encryption based on elliptic curve 
  cryptography, using the Curve25519 algorithm from Daniel Bernstein and 
  based on CurveCP's security handshake. See http://rfc.zlink.org/spec:25, 
  http://rfc.zlink.org/spec:26, and http://curvecp.org.
  
Authentication is done by pluggable "authenticators" that connect to libzlink
over an inproc endpoint, see http://rfc.zlink.org/spec:27.

Socket options to configure PLAIN security on client or server:

* ZLINK_PLAIN_SERVER, ZLINK_PLAIN_USERNAME, ZLINK_PLAIN_PASSWORD. See 
  tests/test_security_plain.
  
Socket options to configure CURVE security on client or server:

* ZLINK_CURVE_SERVER, ZLINK_CURVE_PUBLICKEY, ZLINK_CURVE_SECRETKEY, 
  ZLINK_CURVE_SERVERKEY. See tests/test_security_curve.cpp.
  
Socket options to configure "domain" for ZAP handler:
 
* ZLINK_ZAP_DOMAIN, see tests/test_security_null.cpp.

Support for encoding/decoding CURVE binary keys to ASCII:

* zlink_z85_encode, zlink_z85_decode.

OMQ version 3.1.0 (beta), released on 2011/12/18
================================================

General information
-------------------

Based on community consensus, the 0MQ 3.1.x release reverts a number of
features introduced in version 3.0. The major reason for these changes is
improving backward compatibility with 0MQ 2.1.x.

Development of the 0MQ 3.0.x series will be discontinued, and users are
encouraged to upgrade to 3.1.

The 0MQ 3.1.x releases use ABI version 3.

Reverted functionality
----------------------

The following functionality present in 0MQ 3.0 has been reverted:

* Wire format changes. The 0MQ 3.1 wire format is identical to that of 0MQ
  2.1.

* LABELs and COMMANDs have been removed.

* Explicit identies are re-introduced, however they can be used only for
  explicit routing, not for durable sockets.

* The ZLINK_ROUTER and ZLINK_DEALER socket types are once again aliases for
  ZLINK_XREQ and ZLINK_XREP.

New functionality
-----------------

* The zlink_getmsgopt() function has been introduced.

* Experimental IPv6 support has been introduced. This is disabled by
  default, see the zlink_setsockopt() documentation for enabling it.

Other changes
-------------

* The default HWM for all socket types has been set to 1000.

* Many bug fixes.

Building
--------

* The dependency on libuuid has been removed.

* Support for building on Android, and with MSVC 10 has been added.

0MQ version 3.0.0 (alpha), released on 2011/07/12
=================================================

New functionality
-----------------

* A zlink_ctx_set_monitor() API to register a callback / event sink for changes
  in socket state.

* POSIX-compliant zlink_send and zlink_recv introduced (uses raw buffer
  instead of message object).

* ZLINK_MULTICAST_HOPS socket option added. Sets the appropriate field in
  IP headers of PGM packets.

* Subscription forwarding. Instead of filtering on consumer, the
  subscription is moved as far as possible towards the publisher and
  filtering is done there.

* ZLINK_XPUB, ZLINK_XSUB introduced. Allow to create subscription-
  forwarding-friendly intermediate devices.

* Add sockopt ZLINK_RCVTIMEO/ZLINK_SNDTIMEO. Allow to set timeout for
  blocking send/recv calls.

* A new LABEL flag was added to the wire format. The flag distinguishes
  message parts used by 0MQ (labels) from user payload message parts.

* There is a new wire format for the REQ/REP pattern. First, the empty
  bottom-of-the-stack message part is not needed any more, the LABEL
  flag is used instead. Secondly, peer IDs are 32-bit integers rather
  than 17-byte UUIDs.

* The REQ socket now drops duplicate replies.

* Outstanding requests & replies associated with a client are dropped
  when the clients dies. This is a performance optimisation.

* Introduced ZLINK_ROUTER and ZLINK_DEALER sockets. These mimic the
  functionality of ZLINK_ROUTER and ZLINK_DEALER in 0MQ/2.1.x. Guarantees
  backward compatibility for exsiting code.

* Removed dependency on OS socketpair buffer size. No more asserts in
  mailbox.cpp because of low system limit of sockepair buffer size.

API improvements
----------------

* Obsolete constants ZLINK_UPSTREAM and ZLINK_DOWNSTREAM removed. Use
  ZLINK_PUSH and ZLINK_PULL instead.

* Timeout in zlink_poll is in milliseconds instead of microseconds. This
  makes zlink_poll() compliant with POSIX poll()

* ZLINK_MCAST_LOOP removed. There's no support for multicast over
  loopback any more. Use IPC or TCP isntead.

* zlink_send/zlink_recv was renamed zlink_sendmsg/zlink_recvmsg.

* ZLINK_RECOVERY_IVL and ZLINK_RECOVERY_IVL_MSEC reconciled. The new option
  is named ZLINK_RECOVERY_IVL and the unit is milliseconds.

* Option types changed. Most of the numeric types are now represented
  as 'int'.

* ZLINK_HWM split into ZLINK_SNDHWM and ZLINK_RCVHWM. This makes it possible
  to control message flow separately for each direction.

* ZLINK_NOBLOCK renamed ZLINK_DONTWAIT. That makes it POSIX-compliant.

Less is More
------------

* Pre-built devices and zlink_device() removed. Should be made available
  as a separate project(s).

* ZLINK_SWAP removed. Writing data to disk should be done on top of 0MQ,
  on inside it.

* C++ binding removed from the core. Now it's a separate project, same
  as any other binding.

Bug fixes
---------

* Many.

Building
--------

* Make pkg-config dependency conditional.

Distribution
------------

* Removed Debian packaging, which is now available at packages.debian.org
  or via apt-get.

  if the current directory was not writeable. Behavior now is to return
  -1 at zlink_setsockopt in this situation.

* Fixed issue 207, assertion failure in zlink_connecter.cpp:48, when an
  invalid zlink_connect() string was used, or the hostname could not be
  resolved. The zlink_connect() call now returns -1 in both those cases.

* Fixed issue 218, sockets not opened with SOCK_CLOEXEC, causing fork/exec
  to sit on sockets unnecessarily.

* Fixed issue 250, build errors on Windows (Mikko Koppanen).

  used on an empty set, on Windows.

* Fixed issue 239, assertion failure in zlink.cpp:223, when ZLINK_SWAP was
  used with explicit identities and multiple SUB sockets.

* Fixed issue 236, zlink_send() and zlink_recv() did not always return
  error conditions such as EFSM properly. This bug was introduced in
  version 2.1.8 by the backport of changes for issue 231.

Building
--------

* 0MQ support for Android added (Bill Roberts, Mikko Koppanen).


0MQ version 2.1.8 (RC), released on 2011/07/28

---------

* Fixed issue 223, assertion failure in tcp_connecter.cpp:300 when
  connecting to a server that is on an unreachable network (errno is
  equal to ENETUNREACH).

* Fixed issue 228, assertion failure at rep.cpp:88 when HWM was reached.

  (bug was introduced in 2.1.6 as part of message validity checking).

* Fixed issue 211, REP socket asserted if sent malformed envelope (old issue
  due to abuse of assertions for error checking).

* Fixed issue 212, reconnect failing after resume from sleep on Windows
  (due to not handling WSAENETDOWN).

  before server binds).

* Fixed memory leak with threads on Windows.

Changes
-------

* Checks zlink_msg_t validity at each operation.

* Inproc performance tests now work on Windows.

* PGM wire format specification improved in zlink_pgm(7)

0MQ version 2.1.4 (Stable), released on 2011/03/30
==================================================

Bug fixes
---------

* Fix to OpenPGM which was asserting on small messages (Steven McCoy).

Changes
-------

* Upgraded OpenPGM to version 5.1.115 (Pieter Hintjens).

* OpenPGM build changed to not install OpenPGM artifacts.


0MQ version 2.1.3 (Stable), released on 2011/03/21
==================================================

Bug fixes
---------

* Fix to PUSH sockets, which would sometimes deliver tail frames of a
  multipart message to new subscribers (Martin Sustrik).

* Fix to PUB sockets, which would sometimes deliver tail frames of a
  multipart message to new subscribers (Martin Sustrik).

* Windows build was broken due to EPROTONOSUPPORT not being defined. This
  has now been fixed (Martin Sustrik).

* Various fixes to make OpenVMS port work (Brett Cameron).

* Corrected Reference Manual to note that ZLINK_LINGER socket option may be
  set at any time, not just before connecting/binding (Pieter Hintjens).

* Fix to C++ binding to properly close sockets (Guido Goldstein).

* Removed obsolete assert from pgm_socket.cpp (Martin Sustrik).

Changes
-------

* Removed stand-alone devices (/devices subdirectory) from distribution.
  These undocumented programs remain available in older packages (Pieter
  Hintjens).

* OpenPGM default rate raised to 40mbps by default (Steven McCoy).

* ZLINK_DEALER and ZLINK_ROUTER macros provided to ease upgrade to 0MQ/3.0.
  These are scheduled to replace ZLINK_XREQ and ZLINK_XREP (Pieter Hintjens).

* Added man page for zlink_device(3) which was hereto undocumented (Pieter
  Hintjens).

* Removed zlink_queue(3), zlink_forwarder(3), zlink_streamer(3) man pages
  (Pieter Hintjens).

OpenPGM Integration
-------------------

* Upgraded OpenPGM to version 5.1.114 (Steven McCoy, Mikko Koppanen).

* Build system now calls OpenPGM build process directly, allowing easier
  future upgrades of OpenPGM (Mikko Koppanen).

* Build system allows configuration with arbitrary versions of OpenPGM
  (./configure --with-pgm=libpgm-x.y.z) (Mikko Koppanen).

* OpenPGM uses new PGM_ODATA_MAX_RTE controlling original data instead of
  PGM_TXW_MAX_RTE covering entire channel (Steven McCoy).

Building
--------

* 0MQ builds properly on FreeBSD (Mikko Koppanen).


0MQ version 2.1.2 (rc2), released on 2011/03/06
===============================================

Bug fixes
---------

* 0MQ now correctly handles durable inproc sockets; previously it ignored
  explicit identities on inproc sockets.

* Various memory leaks were fixed.

* OpenPGM sender/receiver creation fixed.


0MQ version 2.1.1 (rc1), released on 2011/02/23
===============================================

New functionality
-----------------

* New socket option ZLINK_RECONNECT_IVL_MAX added, allows for exponential
  back-off strategy when reconnecting.

* New socket option ZLINK_RECOVERY_IVL_MSEC added, as a fine-grained
  counterpart to ZLINK_RECOVERY_IVL (for multicast transports).

* If memory is exhausted, 0MQ warns with an explicit message before
  aborting the process.

* Size of inproc HWM and SWAP is sum of peers' HWMs and SWAPs (Douglas
  Greager, Martin Sustrik).

Bug fixes
---------

* 0MQ no longer asserts in mailbox.cpp when multiple peers connect with
  the same identity.

* 0MQ no longer asserts when rejecting an oversized message.

* 0MQ no longer asserts in pipe.cpp when the swap fills up.

* zlink_poll now works correctly with an empty poll set.

* Many more.

Building
--------

* 0MQ now builds correctly on CentOS, Debian 6, and SunOS/gcc3.

* Added WithOpenPGM configuration into MSVC builds.

Known issues
------------

* OpenPGM integration is still not fully stable.


0MQ version 2.1.0 (Beta), released on 2010/12/01
================================================

New functionality
-----------------

* New semantics for zlink_close () and zlink_term () ensure that all messages
  are sent before the application terminates. This behaviour may be
  modified using the new ZLINK_LINGER socket option; for further details
  refer to the reference manual.

* The new socket options ZLINK_FD and ZLINK_EVENTS provide a way to integrate
  0MQ sockets into existing poll/event loops.

* Sockets may now be migrated between OS threads, as long as the
  application ensures that a full memory barrier is issued.

* The 0MQ ABI exported by libzlink.so has been formalised; DSO symbol
  visibility is used on supported platforms to ensure that only public ABI
  symbols are exported. The library ABI version has been set to 1.0.0 for
  this release.

* OpenPGM has been updated to version 5.0.92. This version no longer
  depends on GLIB, and integration with 0MQ should be much improved.

* zlink_poll() now honors timeouts precisely, and no longer returns if no
  events are signaled.

* Blocking calls now return EINTR if interrupted by the delivery of a
  signal; this also means that language bindings which previously had
  problems with handling SIGINT/^C should now work correctly.

* The ZLINK_TYPE socket option was added; this allows retrieval of the socket
  type after creation.

* Added a ZLINK_VERSION macro to zlink.h for compile-time API version
  detection.

* The ZLINK_RECONNECT_IVL and ZLINK_BACKLOG socket options have been added.

Bug fixes
---------

* Forwarder and streamer devices now handle multi-part messages correctly.

* 0MQ no longer asserts when malformed data is received on the wire.

* 0MQ internal timers now work correctly if the TSC jumps backwards.

* The internal signalling functionality (mailbox) has been improved
  to automatically resize socket buffers on POSIX systems.

* Many more.

Building
--------

* 0MQ now builds correctly with many more non-GCC compilers (Sun Studio,
  Intel ICC, CLang).

* AIX and HP-UX builds should work now.

* FD_SETSIZE has been set to 1024 by default for MSVC builds.

* Windows builds using GCC (MinGW) now work out of the box.

Distribution
------------

* A simple framework for regression tests has been added, along with a few
  basic self-tests. The tests can be run using "make check".
